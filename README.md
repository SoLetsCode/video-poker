In Video Poker you are dealt 5 random cards and you have one chance to hold certain cards. If your final hand has a pair of jacks or better, you will win.

This application will teach you which cards to hold using basic strategy. Hands are based on 5 credit bets on Jacks or Better with a 6/9 payout table. There's an approximate 99% return if played correctly. Use the trainer button to learn what cards to hold.
